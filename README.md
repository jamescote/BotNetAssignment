# BotNetAssignment
Small IRC botnet program for CPSC 526

Developed as a Networking assignment. Using an IRC chat, the program listens on the IRC channel for commands. A Master will issue commands that can create a number of bots. Each bot listens to commands as well with a particular password. Once a command is given, the bots execute the command and report their success back to the one that issued the command. The master program calculates how many succeeded in the command.
